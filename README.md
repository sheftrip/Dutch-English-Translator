# Dutch-English-Translator
Implemented a Cross Lingual Document Translator, using Statistical Machine Translation model. 
The statistical model, IBM Model 1, has been trained for alignment and translation. 
Performance metrics such as cosine similarity and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient, have also been implemented in the translator.

This project was done in a group of five as a part of the course, Information Retrieval.

Files containing the text on which the translator was trained have not been uplaoded due to size restrictions.
